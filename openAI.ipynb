It encompasses Delhi and several districts surrounding it from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The NCR and the associated National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve harmonized policies for the control of land-uses and development of infrastructure in the region. Prominent cities of the NCR include Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida.\n",
      "The NCR is a rural-urban region, with a population of over 46,069,000 and an urbanisation level of 62.6%. As well as cities and towns, the NCR contains ecologically sensitive areas like the Aravalli ridge, forests, wildlife and bird sanctuaries. The Delhi Extended Urban Agglomeration, a part of the NCR, had an estimated GDP of $370 billion (measured in terms of GDP PPP) in 2015–16.\n",

      "Summary: Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river, but spread chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.\n",

All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a notable centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.

New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the 2012 BRICS summit, the 2023 G20 summit, and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 and 2023 Cricket World Cups.\n",

Determining the exact population of New Delhi is tricky because the definition of \"New Delhi\" can be fluid, encompassing different administrative areas.  Sometimes it's used interchangeably with the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), which includes areas beyond what's strictly considered \"New Delhi.\"\n",

However, this includes the entire NCT, not just the area specifically designated as New Delhi.  Finding a precise population figure for *only* New Delhi is difficult; official statistics tend to focus on the larger NCT region.  Therefore, while the NCT of Delhi has roughly 30 million people, I cannot give you a precise population number for New Delhi itself.\n",

While there's some debate about the exact size depending on individual whales and measurement techniques, Antarctic blue whales are generally considered larger than other blue whale subspecies.  They can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weigh up to 200 tons (181 metric tons).  Their immense size is a result of their filter-feeding lifestyle in the productive Antarctic waters, allowing them to consume vast quantities of krill.\n",
